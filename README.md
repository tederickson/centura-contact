# Overview
Weâ€™d like him to build an API in Java or Javascript that returns a contact from a contact list.

# Design

# Initial Setup Choices
1. Spring Boot DevTools - DEVELOPER TOOLS - Provides fast application restarts, LiveReload, and configurations for enhanced development experience.
1. Lombok - DEVELOPER TOOLS - Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.
1. Spring Configuration Processor - DEVELOPER TOOLS - Generate metadata for developers to offer contextual help and "code completion" when working with custom configuration keys (ex.application.properties/.yml files).
1. Spring Web - WEB - Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.
1. Spring Data JPA - SQL - Persist data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.
1. H2 Database - SQL - Provides a fast in-memory database that supports JDBC API and R2DBC access, with a small (2mb) footprint. Supports embedded and server modes as well as a browser based console application.

# Implicit Design Steps
* Separation of Concern - the requirements will change.  You need to make the application fault tolerant and loosely coupled.  Separation of Concern means you do not push the database table Object out to the presentation layer.  Any changes to the database would cause ripples in the service and presentation code. Enforce loose coupling so that changes are confined to the database and service layer.  
    * Database Layer - this is the database model and the repositories that access the database.  The JPARepository interface handles a lot of the DAO code. The layer uses model and repository packages. 
    * Service Layer - knows about database layer and converts those objects to generic digests.  The service layer handles the business logic.  The layer uses the domain, model, repository and service packages.
    * Presentation Layer - knows about the Service layer, has no idea the database layer exists. In this case the Presentation layer handles the API interaction with the outside world.  Validates requests and authorization.  Also handles version changes. The layer uses the rest, service and domain packages.
    
* Security - use HTTPS.  Security is broken down into two parts - AuthN (Authentication) and AuthZ (Authorization).  Up to your organization if using OAuth 2.0, or Single Signon with SAML, or JSON web tokens, or api tokens or ...
    * Provide the least amount of authorization possible
    * Default to deny instead of approve
    
* Never expose information on URLs.  User names, passwords, API tokens, any Personal Identifiable Information should not be part of the URL.
* Provide the minimum amount of feedback - ETrade had different login error messages for invalid user or invalid password.  Bad actors used that information to find a list of valid user ids.  After that they worked on trying to hack the passwords.  A simple "invalid user id or password" message stopped that attack vector.

* Show how to handle changing business requirements by using versioning.
    * Provide the version number as part of the URI.  That allows clients to interact with the same version.  Otherwise a requirement change could break their code.  
    * Another option is GraphQL.  We used [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) at Ibotta to handle version changes.  

* Documentation - I prefer [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).  The documentation is generated from the code.  We ran into documentation drift issues at a previous company because a different group was supposed to update the API documentation. 

* Testing - Unit test each piece.  Unit tests provide validation for refactoring code.  Integration and Unit tests validate the acceptance criteria.

# REST Design Steps
1. Understand the Object Model - this will change as requirements evolve.  
    * The Contact Object has a name and a phone number.  The name will change to two fields: first and last name.
    * The next change is to add an email address
    * Then add multiple phone numbers
    * Then add physical address
    
1. Create Model URIs.  A contact has CRUD operations:
    * Create - /contact
    * Read -   /contact/**{id}**
    * Update - /contact/**{id}**
    * Update phone - /contact/**{id}**/phone
    * Delete - /contact/**{id}**
1. Another part of the Model URI are the collection operations (these only involve GET or Read operations.  Bulk update is a bad idea):
    * Retrieve all - this needs optional parameters to handle paging. A starting page and number of results on each page.
        * /contacts?start={beginning index}&size={number of results}
    * Search - suggest breaking up into search first name and search last name 
        * /contacts/search_first_name/{name}?wildcard={true}
        * /contacts/search_last_name/{name}?wildcard={true} 

1. Assign HTTP verbs - read is GET, create is POST, update is PUT or PATCH, delete is DELETE. I prefer additional small URIs to update part of resource instead of a PATCH with a lot of internal switching code.  HEAD is a read that has no content, usually employed when you want to check if the resource has changed or the resource will fit in your storage.

# Implementation
1. The schema.sql contains the database schema.
1. The data.sql file contains SQL commands to run at start up.
1. Implement version 1 and 2 of the API.  
    * Two digests, services and REST Controllers.  
    * The database model and schema are changed.  
    * The version 1 service and controller still return the version 1 digest.  
    * The version 2 digest shows the new fields. 
    * The version 2 controller and service are similar to version 1.  Bug fixes are confined to the different versions.  Easier to maintain than a bunch of if(version 1){} else if(version 2) control flow statements.
    * Easier to delete obsolete code.  Once version x is no longer supported, remove the digest, service, controller and tests.
